# FRCPythonProcessing
Tools and Scrips for graphing and data visualtion of FRC scouting data.

### Origin Story
The First scrips for data analysis began in the tail-end of the 2018 season. The project was spearheaded by mentor Ted Larson-Freeman. 

### Mission
The code located in this repository serves the purpose of:

    1. Be a drive team resource
    2. Be an analysis/evaluation tool for other teams
    3. Act as a learning ground for programmers

### History
    2018/06/xx - The repository is currently being refactored from the end of the 2018 season. Code is being consolodated, .gitignore is being fixed, ect.
    
### Building
Currently, this repositroy acts as a collection point for many small, mutially exclusive scripts. Said scripts range from Python 3 to R. So long as you have the required dependencies and languages installed, everything should run smoothly. Note: Many of the scrips here will  output graphs in a fairly un-sterlized manner.
